# SPECT Tomographic Reconstruction 3D Slicer Extension
An early prototype for SPECT tomographi reconstruction in 3D slicer. In order to use

1. Clone this repository locally
2. On 3D slicer go ''Edit->Application Settings->Modules'' and add `.../slicer_gui/SlicerSPECTRecon` to "Additional Module paths"
3. Under the typical Modules dropdown menu, there should now be a "Tomographic Reconstruction" category which contains the extension.
